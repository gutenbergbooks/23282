<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ON PORTRAITS OF DISTINGUISHED ENGLISHMEN.</h3>

  <p>In submitting to you the following brief observations, it is neither
  my wish nor intention to undervalue or disparage the labours of Horace
  Walpole, and Granger, and Pennant, and Lodge, and the numerous writers
  who have followed in their train, and to whom we are so much indebted for
  their notices of a great variety of original portraits of distinguished
  Englishmen, which still adorn the mansions of our aristocracy, and are
  found in the smaller collections throughout the realm. But I may be
  permitted to express my surprise and regret that in this age of inquiry
  no general catalogue of these national treasures should ever have been
  published. It is true that the portraits, as well as the other objects of
  attraction in our royal palaces, have been described in print with
  tolerable accuracy, and some good accounts are to be met with of the
  pictures at Woburn, and Blenheim, and Althorpe, and many of the
  residences of the nobility which can boast their local historian. We are,
  however, in most cases obliged to content ourselves with the meagre
  information afforded by county topography, or such works as the
  <i>Beauties of England</i>, <i>Neale's Country Seats</i>, and
  unsatisfactory guide-books.</p>

  <p>No one, then, can doubt that such a compilation as I am advocating
  would prove a most welcome addition to our increasing stock of historical
  lore, and greatly assist the biographer in those researches upon which,
  from no sufficient materials being at hand, too much time is frequently
  expended without any adequate result. A catalogue would also tend to the
  preservation of ancient portraits, which, by being brought into notice,
  would acquire more importance in the estimation of the possessors; and in
  the event of any old houses falling into decay, the recorded fact of
  certain pictures having existed there, would cause them to be inquired
  after, and rescue them from destruction. Opportunities would likewise be
  afforded of correcting misnomers, and testing the authenticity of reputed
  likenesses of the same individual; further, the printed lists would
  survive after all the family traditions had been forgotten, and passed
  away with the antiquated housekeeper, and her worn-out inventory. The
  practice, too, of inscribing the names of the artist and person
  represented on the backs of the frames, would probably be better
  observed; and I may mention as a proof of this precaution being
  necessary, the instance of a <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page234"></a>{234}</span>baronet in our day having inherited an old
  house full of pictures, which were <i>one and all</i> described, in
  laconic and most unsatisfactory terms, as "<i>Portraits of Ladies and
  Gentlemen Unknown</i>." The losses of works of art and interest by the
  lamentable fires that have occurred so frequently within the memory of
  man, may furnish a further motive for using every endeavour to preserve
  those pictures that remain to us; but probably a far greater number have
  perished from damp or neglect, and a strange combination of mischief and
  ignorance. Let us hope that in this respect the times are improving. For
  one, I cannot consent to the wanton destruction of a single portrait,
  though Horace Walpole assures us&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That it is almost as necessary that the representations of men should
  perish and quit the scene to their successors, as it is that the human
  race should give place to rising generations; and, indeed, the mortality
  is almost as rapid. Portraits that cost twenty, thirty, sixty guineas,
  and that proudly take possession of the drawing-room, give way in the
  next generation to the new married couple, descending into the parlour,
  where they are slightly mentioned as my <i>father</i> and <i>mother's</i>
  pictures. When they become my <i>grandfather</i> and <i>grandmother</i>,
  they mount to the two pair of stairs, and then, unless dispatched to the
  mansion-house in the country, or crowded into the housekeeper's room,
  they perish among the lumber of garrets, or flutter into rags before a
  broker's shop at the Seven Dials."&mdash;<i>Lives of the Painters</i>,
  vol. iv. pp. 14, 15.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am tempted to add, that many years ago I saw a large roll of canvass
  produced from under a bed at a furniture shop in "Hockley in the Hole,"
  which, when unfolded, displayed a variety of old portraits, that had been
  torn out of their frames, and stowed away like worn-out sail-cloth; the
  place was so filthy that I was glad to make my escape without further
  investigation, but I noticed a whole-length of a judge in scarlet robes,
  and I could not help reflecting how much surprised the painter and the
  son of the law whom he delineated would have been, could they have
  anticipated the fate of the picture.</p>

  <p>Having made these remarks, I am not unaware how much easier it is to
  point out a grievance than to provide a remedy; but perhaps some of your
  readers more conversant with such matters, may form an opinion whether it
  would answer to any one to undertake to compile such a catalogue as I
  have described. Though much would remain to be done, a great deal of
  information is to be gleaned from printed works, and doubtless lists of
  portraits might be in many instances procured from the persons who are
  fortunate enough to possess them. It should also be remembered that
  amongst the MSS. of Sir William Musgrave in the British Museum, there are
  many inventories of English portraits, affording a strong presumption
  that he may once have meditated such a publication as I have pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>But, whether we are ever to have a catalogue or not, some advantage
  may arise from the discussion of the subject in "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>;" and if it should lead to the rescue of a single
  portrait from destruction, we shall have advanced one step in the right
  direction.</p>

<h3>STORY OF A RELIC.</h3>

  <p>P. C. S. S. found, some days ago, the following curious story in a
  rare little Portuguese book in his possession, and he now ventures to
  send a translation of it to the "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>." The work was printed at Vienna in 1717, and is an
  account of the embassy of Fernando Telles da Sylva, Conde de Villa Mayor,
  from the court of Lisbon to that of Vienna, to demand in marriage, for
  the eldest son of King Pedro II. of Portugal, the hand of the Archduchess
  Maria Anna of Austria. It was written by Father Francisco da Fonseca, a
  Jesuit priest, who accompanied the ambassador in quality of almoner and
  confessor, and is full of amusing matter, particularly in reference to
  the strange opinions concerning our laws, government, and religion, which
  the worthy padre appears to have picked up during his short stay in
  England.</p>

  <p>The original of the annexed translation is to be found at pp. 318,
  319, 320. § 268. of Fonseca's Narrative.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As we are now upon the subject of miracles wrought by Relics in
  Vienna, I shall proceed to relate another prodigy which happened in the
  said city, and which will greatly serve to confirm in us those feelings
  of piety with which we are wont to venerate such sacred objects. The
  Count Harrach, who was greatly favoured by the Duke of Saxony, begged of
  him, as a present, a few of the many relics which the duke preserved in
  his treasury, assuredly less out of devotion than for the sake of their
  rarity and value. The duke, with his usual benignity, acceded to this
  request, and gave orders that sundry vials should be dispatched to the
  count, filled with most indubitable relics of Our Lord, of the Blessed
  Virgin, of the Apostles, of the Innocents, and of other holy persons. He
  directed two Lutheran ministers to pack these vials securely in a
  precious casket, which the duke himself sealed up with his own signet,
  and sent off to Vienna. On its arrival there, it was deposited in the
  chapel of the count, which is situated in the street called Preiner. The
  count immediately informed the bishop of the arrival of this treasure,
  and invited him to witness the opening of the casket, and to attend for
  the purpose of verifying its contents. Accordingly the bishop came, and
  on opening the casket, there proceeded from it such an abominable stench,
  that no man could endure it, infecting, as it did, the whole of the
  chapel. The bishop thereupon ordered all the vials to be taken out, and
  carefully examined one by one, hoping to ascertain the cause of this
  strange incident, which did not long remain a mystery, for they soon <!--
  Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>found
  the very vial from which this pestilent odour was issuing. It contained a
  small fragment of cloth, which was thus labelled, '<i>Ex caligis Divi
  Martini Lutheri</i>,' that is to say, '<i>A bit of the Breeches of Saint

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHAUCER, NO. II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Complaint of Mars and Venus.</i></p>

  <p>I am not aware that the obvious astronomical allegory, which lurks in
  Chaucer's "Complaint of Mars and Venus," has been pointed out, or that
  any attempt has been made to explain it. In Tyrwhitt's slight notice of
  that poem, prefixed to his glossary, there is not the most remote hint
  that he perceived its astronomical significance, or that he looked upon
  it in any other light than "that it was intended to describe the
  situation of <i>some</i> two lovers under a veil of mystical
  allegory."</p>

  <p>But, as I understand it, it plainly describes an astronomical
  conjunction of the planets Mars and Venus, in the last degree of Taurus,
  and on the 12th of April.</p>

  <p>These three conditions are not likely to concur except at very rare
  intervals&mdash;it is possible they may have been only
  theoretical&mdash;but it is also possible that they may have really
  occurred under Chaucer's observation; it might therefore well repay the
  labour bestowed upon it if some person, possessed of time, patience, and
  the requisite tables, would calculate whether any conjunction, conforming
  in such particulars, did really take place within the latter half of the
  fourteenth century: if it was considered worth while to search out a
  described conjunction 2500 years before Christ, in order to test the
  credibility of Chinese records, it would surely be not less interesting
  to confirm the accuracy of Chaucer's astronomy, of his fondness for
  which, and of his desire to bring it forward on all possible occasions,
  he has given so many proofs in his writings.</p>

  <p>The data to be gathered from the little poem in question are
  unfortunately neither very numerous nor very definite; but I think the
  following points are sufficiently plain.</p>

  <p>1st. The entrance of Mars into the sign Taurus (<i>domus Veneris</i>),
  wherein an assignation has been made between him and Venus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That Mars shall enter as fast as he may glide,</p>
      <p>In to her <i>next palais</i> to abide,</p>
      <p>Walking his course 'till she had him ytake,</p>
      <p>And he prayed her to hast her for his sake."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>2nd. The nearly double velocity in apparent ecliptic motion of Venus
  as compared with Mars:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wherefore she spedded as fast in her way</p>
      <p>Almost in one day as he did in tway."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>3d. The conjunction:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The great joy that was betwix hem two,</p>
      <p>When they be mette, there may no long tell.</p>
      <p>There is no more&mdash;but into bed they go."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>4th. The entrance of the Sun into Taurus, as indicated in the
  unceremonious intrusion of Phebus into Venus' chamber; which, as though
  to confirm its identity with Taurus,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Depainted was with white <i>boles</i> grete;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>whereupon Mars complains:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This twelve dayes of April I endure</p>
      <p>Through jelous Phebus this misaventure."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>(It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader of Chaucer, that in the
  poet's time the Sun would enter Taurus on the 12th of April.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now flieth Venus in to Ciclinius tour,</p>
      <p>With void corse, for fear of Phebus light."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These two lines, so obscure at first sight, afford, when properly
  understood, the strongest confirmation of the astronomical meaning of the
  whole; while, by indicating the conjunction on the last degree of Taurus,
  they furnish a most essential element for its identification.</p>

  <p>I confess that this "<span class="sc">Ciclinius</span>" gave me a good
  deal of trouble; but, taking as a guide the astronomical myth so evident
  throughout, I came to the conviction that "Ciclinius" is a corruption,
  and that Chaucer wrote, or intended to write, <span
  class="sc">Cyllenius</span>&mdash;a well-known epithet of <i>Mercury</i>,
  and used too in an astronomical sense by Virgil, "<i>ignis c&oelig;li
  Cyllenius</i>."</p>

  <p>Now <i>the sign Gemini</i> is also "<i>domus Mercurii</i>;" so that
  when Venus fled into the tour of Cyllenius, she simply slipped into the
  next door to her own house of Taurus&mdash;leaving poor Mars behind to
  halt after her as he best might.</p>

  <p>6th. Mars is almost stationary:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He passeth but a sterre in daies two."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There still remain one or two baffling points in the description, one
  of which is the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Fro Venus Valanus might this palais see,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which I am convinced is corrupt: I have formed a guess as to its true
  meaning, but it is not as yet fully confirmed.</p>

  <p>The other doubtful points are comprised in the following lines, which
  have every appearance of significance; and which, I have not the least
  doubt, bear as close application as those already explained: but, as yet,
  I must acknowledge an inability to understand the allusions. After Venus
  has entered Gemini&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Within the gate she fled into a cave:</p>
      <p>Dark was this cave and smoking as the hell;</p>
      <p>Nat but two paas within the gate it stood,</p>
      <p><i>A natural day in darke I let her dwell</i>."</p>

<h3>CHARLES THE FIRST AND BARTOLOMEO DELLA
NAVE'S COLLECTION OF PICTURES.</h3>

  <p>Among some miscellaneous papers in a volume of the Birch MSS. in the
  British Museum (Add. 4293. fol. 5.) is preserved a curious document
  illustrative of the love of Charles I. for the fine arts, and his anxiety
  to increase his collection of paintings, which, as it has escaped the
  notice of Walpole and his annotators, I transcribe below.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="sc">Charles R.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Whereas wee vnderstand that an excellent Collection of paintings are
  to be solde in Venice, whiche are knowen by the name of Bartolomeo della
  Nave his Collection, Wee are desirous that our beloved servant Mr.
  William Pettye, should goe thither to make the bargayne for them, Wee our
  selues beinge resolved to goe a fourthe share in the buyinge of them (soe
  it exceed not the s&#x14D;me of Eight hundred powndes sterlinge), but
  that our Name be concealed in it. And if it shall please God that the
  same Collection be bought and come safelye hither, Then wee doe promise
  in the word of a Kinge, that they shall be divyded with all equallitye in
  this maner, vid<sup>t</sup>. That, they shall be equallie divyded into
  fower partes by some men skillfull in paintinge, and then everie one
  interested in the shares, or some for them, shall throwe the Dice
  severallye, and whoesoever throwes moste, shall chose his share first,
  and soe in order everye one shall choose after first, as he castes most,
  and shal take their shares freelye to their owne vses, as they shall fall
  vnto them. In wittnes whereof wee haue sett our hande, this Eight daye of
  July, in the Tenth year of our Reigne, 1634."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The individual employed by Charles in this negotiation is the same who
  collected antiquities in Greece for the Earl of Arundel. He was Vicar of
  Thorley, in the Isle of Wight, and is believed to have been the uncle of
  the celebrated Sir William Petty, ancestor of the Marquis of Lansdowne.
  It would be curious to learn the particulars of the "bargayne" made by
  him, and how the pictures were disposed of after their arrival in
  England. Were the Warrant and Privy Seal books of the period (still
  remaining among the Exchequer records) easily accessible, no doubt some
  information on these points might be gained. That this collection of
  Bartolomeo della Nave was a celebrated one, we have the testimony of
  Simon Vouet, in a letter to Ferrante Carlo, written from Venice, August
  14, 1627, in which he speaks of it as a "studio di bellissime pitture"
  (Bottari, <i>Lettere Pittoriche</i>, vol. i. p. 335.: Milano, 1822): and
  that it came over to England, is asserted repeatedly by Ridolfi, in his
  <i>Vite degli illustri Pittori Veneti</i>, the first edition of which
  appeared at Venice in 1648. He mentions in this work several paintings
  which were in Della Nave's collection, and which it may be interesting to
  refer to here, in case they are still to be traced in England. In vol. i.
  p. 107. (I quote the Padua edition of 1835) is noticed a painting by
  Vincenzio Catena, representing Judith carrying the head of Holofernes in
  one hand, and a sword in the other. In the same volume, p. 182., a
  portrait of Zattina by Palma il Vecchio, holding in her hand "una zampina
  dorata;" and at p. 263. several sacred subjects by Titian among which is
  specified one of the Virgin surrounded by Saints, and another of the
  woman taken in adultery, with "multi ritratti" by the same. Again, at p.
  288., a head of a lady, supposed to be the mother of the artist Nadelino
  da Murano, one of the most talented pupils of Titian; and at p. 328. a
  painting by Andrea Schiavone, and some designs of Parmigiano. In vol. ii.
  p. 123. are mentioned two paintings by Battista Zelotti from Ovid's
  Fables; and at p. 141. a picture of the good Samaritan, by Jacopo da
  Ponte of Bassano. For these references to Bottari and Ridolfi, I own
  myself indebted to Mr. William Carpenter, the keeper of the department of
  engravings in the British Museum; and, probably, some of your readers may
  contribute further illustrations of Bartolomeo della Nave's collection of
  pictures, and of the purchase of them by Charles I. I do not find this
  purchase noticed in Vanderdort's list of Charles's pictures, published by
  Walpole in 1757.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Nonsuch Palace.</i>&mdash;Our antiquarian friends may not be aware
  that traces of this old residence of Elizabeth are still to be seen near
  Ewell. Traditions of it exist in the neighbourhood and Hansetown, and
  Elizabethan coins are frequently dug up near the foundations of the
  "Banquetting House," now inclosed in a cherry orchard not far from the
  avenue that joins Ewell to Cheam. In a field at some distance is an old
  elm, which the villagers say once stood in the court-yard of the kitchen.
  Near this is a deep trench, now filled with water, and hedged by bushes,
  which is called "Diana's Dyke," now in the midst of a broad ploughed
  field, but formerly the site of a statue of the Grecian goddess, which
  served as a fountain in an age when water-works were found in every
  palace-garden, evincing in their subjects proofs of the revival of
  classical learning. The elm above-mentioned measures thirty feet in the
  girth, immediately below the parting of the branches. Its age is "frosty
  but kindly;" some two or three hundred summers have passed over its old
  head, which, as yet, is unscathed by heavens fire, and unriven by its
  bolt. The ground here swells unequally and artificially, and in an
  adjoining field, long called, no one knew why, "the Conduit Field," pipes
  that brought the water to the palace have lately been found, and may be
  seen intersected by the embankments of the Epsom railway.</p>

  <p>The avenue itself is one of the old approaches to the palace, and was
  the scene of a skirmish during the civil wars. <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>{237}</span></p>

  <p>Your readers may, perhaps, forget that this palace was the scene of
  the fatal disgrace of young Essex.</p>

  <p><i>Ferrar and Benlowes.</i>&mdash;The preface to that very singular
  poem, <i>Theophila: Love's Sacrifice</i>. Lond. 1652, by Edw. Benlowes,
  contains a passage so closely resembling the inscription "in the great
  parlour" at Little Gidding (Peckard's <i>Life of Nic. Ferrar</i>, p.
  234), that the coincidence cannot have been accidental, and, if it has
  not been elsewhere pointed out, may be worth record. As the inscription,
  thought not dated, was set up during the life of Ferrar, who died in
  1637, the imitation was evidently not <i>his</i>. Only so much of the
  inscription is here given as is requisite to show the parallel.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He who (by reproof of our errors, and remonstrance of that which is
  more perfect) seeks to make us better, is welcome as an Angel of God: and
  he who (by a cheerful participation of that which is good) confirms us in
  the same, is welcome as a Christian friend. But he who faults us in
  absence, for that which in presence he made show to approve of, doth by a
  double guilt of flattery and slander violate the bands both of friendship
  and charity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus writes Benlowes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He who shall contribute to the improvement of the author, either by a
  prudent detection of an errour, or a sober communication of an
  irrefragable truth, deserves the venerable esteem and welcome of a good
  Angel. And he who by a candid adherence unto, and a fruitful
  participation of, what is good and pious, confirms him therein, merits
  the honourable entertainment of a faithful friend: but he who shall
  traduce him in absence for what in presence he would seem to applaud,
  incurres the double guilt of flattery and slander: and he who wounds him
  with ill reading and misprision, does execution on him before
  judgement."</p>

  <p><i>Traditions from remote Periods through few Links</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  206.).&mdash;The communication of H.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;B., showing how a subject of our
  beloved Queen Victoria can, with the intervention, as a lawyer would say,
  of "three lives," connect herself with one who was a liegeman of that
  very dissimilar monarch, Richard III., reminds me of a fact which I have
  long determined in some way to commit to record. It is this: My father,
  who is only sixty-eight years old, is connected in a similar mode with a
  person who had the plague during the prevalence of that awful scourge in
  the metropolis in the year 1665, with the intervention of <i>one</i> life
  only. My grandfather, John Lower of Alfriston, co. Sussex, distinctly
  remembered an aged woman, who died at the adjacent village of Berwick at
  about ninety, and who had, in her fourth year, recovered from that
  frightful disease. Should it please Providence to spare my father's life
  to see his eighty-third birthday, the recollections of three persons will
  thus connect events separated by a period of two centuries.</p>

  <p>I may take this opportunity of mentioning a fact which may interest
  such of the readers of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" as are
  students of natural history. My grandfather, who was born in the year
  1735 (being the son of Henry Lower, born on the night of the memorable
  storm of November, 1703), was among the very last of those who engaged in
  the sport of <i>bustard-hunting</i> in the South Downs. This bird has
  been extinct, on at least the eastern portion of that range, for upwards
  of a century. The sport was carried on by means of dogs which hunted down
  the poor birds, and the sticks of the human (or <i>in</i>human?) pursuers
  did the rest. My ancestor was "in at the death" of the last of the
  bustards, somewhere about 1747, being then twelve years old.</p>

  <p><i>Longevity.</i>&mdash;Some few years since I had occasion to search
  the parish registers of Evercreech in Somersetshire, in one of which I
  met with the following astounding entry:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ANCIENT DANISH ITINERARY: PROL IN ANGLIAM.</h3>

  <p>An ancient scholiast on Adam of Bremen, "paululum Adamo ratione ætatis
  inferior," according to his editor, Joachim Maderus, supplies us with a
  curious list of the stations in the voyages from Ripa, in Denmark, to
  Acre, in the Holy Land. Adam of Bremen's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>
  dates toward the end of the eleventh century, about 1070. His text is as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Alterum (episcopatum) in Ripa; quæ civitas alio tangitur alveo, qui
  ab oceano influit, et per quem vela torquentur in Fresiam, vel in nostram
  Saxoniam, vel certe in Angliam."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The scholiast has this note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"De Ripa in Flandriam ad <i>Cuicfal</i> velificari potest duobus
  diebus, et totidem noctibus; de Cuicfal ad <i>Prol in Angliam</i> duobus
  diebus et una nocte. <i>Illud est ultimum caput Angliæ versus
  Austrum</i>, et est processus illuc de Ripa angulosus inter Austrum et
  Occidentem. De Prol in Britanniam ad Sanctum Matthiam, uno
  die,&mdash;inde ad Far, juxta Sanctum Jacobum tribus noctibus. Inde
  Leskebone duobus diebus inter Austrum et Occidentem. De Leskebone ad
  Narvese tribus diebus et tribus noctibus, angulariter inter Orientem et
  Austrum. De Narvese ad Arruguen quatuor diebus et quatuor noctibus,
  angulariter inter Aquilonem et Orientem. De Arruguen ad Barzalun uno die,
  similiter inter Aquilonem et Orientem. De Barzalun ad Marsiliam uno die
  et una nocte, fere versus Orientem, declinando tamen parum ad plagam
  Australem. De Marsilia ad Mezein in Siciliam quatuor diebus et quatuor
  noctibus, angulariter inter Orientem et Austrum. De Mezein ad Accharon
  xiiii diebus et totidem noctibus, inter Orientem et Austrum, magis
  appropiando ad Austrum."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We may fairly consider that the stations marked in this itinerary are
  of great antiquity. "Prol in Angliam" is, no doubt, Prawle Point, in
  Devonshire; a headland which must have been well known to the Veneti long
  before the days of Adam of Bremen. Its mention here is one among the many
  proofs of the early importance of this coast, the ancient "Littus
  Totonesium," the scene of one of Marie's fabliaux, and of some curious
  passages in Layamon's <i>Brut</i>, which are not to be found in the poem
  of Wace. I wish to ask,&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Is the word "Prol" Saxon or British, and what is its probable
  etymology?</p>

<h3>CHIMING, TOLLING, AND PEAL-RINGING OF BELLS.</h3>

  <p>Some of your clerical readers, as well as myself, would probably be
  glad to have determined, what are the proper times and measures in which
  the bells of a church ought to be rung. There seems to be no uniformity
  of practice in this matter, nor any authoritative directions, by which
  the customs that obtain may be either improved or regulated. The terms
  chiming, tolling, and peal-ringing, though now generally understood, do
  not intelligibly apply to the few regulations about bells which occur in
  the canons.</p>

  <p>I believe that <i>chiming</i> is the proper method of summoning the
  congregation to the services of the church: and <i>tolling</i> certainly
  appears to be the most appropriate use of the bell at funerals. But
  chiming the bells is an art that is not recognised in the older rules
  respecting their use. For instance, the Fifteenth Canon orders that on
  Wednesdays and Fridays weekly, warning shall be given to the people that
  litany will be said, by <i>tolling of a bell</i>. And, on the other hand,
  though we toll at a funeral, the Sixty-seventh Canon enjoins
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"After the party's death, there shall be rung no <!-- Page 239
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>more but one
  short peal, and one other before the burial, and one other after the
  burial.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The peal here alluded to does not of course mean what <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span> has so clearly described to be a modern
  peal, in Vol. i., p. 154., of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>;" but it would at least amount, I suppose, to
  <i>consonantia campanarum</i>, a ringing together of bells, as
  distinguished from the <i>toll</i> or single stroke on a bell. Horne
  Tooke says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The toll of a bell is its being <i>lifted up</i> (<i>tollere</i>, to
  raise), which causes that sound we call its toll."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The poet does not clear the ambiguity and confusion of terms, when he
  sings&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Faintly as <i>tolls</i> the evening <i>chime</i>!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Peals are not heard in London on Sunday mornings, I believe; but in
  the country, at least hereabouts, they are commonly rung as the summons
  to church, ending with a few strokes on one bell; and then a smaller bell
  than any in the peal (the <i>sanctus</i> bell of old, perhaps, and now
  sometimes vulgarly called "Tom Tinkler") announces that divine service is
  about to begin.</p>

  <p>The object of these remarks is to elicit clearly what is the right way
  of ringing the bells of a church on the several occasions of their being
  used.</p>

<h3>MAZER WOOD: GUTTA PERCHA.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Musæum Tradescantianum, or a Collection of Rarities
  preserved at South Lambeth, near London</i>, by John Tradescant, 1656, I
  find, amongst "other variety of rarities," "the plyable Mazer wood,
  which, being warmed in water, will work to any form;" and a little
  farther on, in the list of "utensils and household stuffe," I also find
  "Mazer dishes." In my opinion, it is more than a coincidence that Doctor
  Montgomery, who, in 1843, received the gold medal of the Society of Arts
  for bringing gutta percha and its useful properties under the notice of
  that body, describes it in almost the same words that Tradescant uses
  when speaking of the pliable Mazer wood: the Doctor says, "it could be
  moulded into any form by merely dipping it into boiling water." It is
  worthy of remark that Tradescant, who was the first botanist of his day,
  seems to have been uncertain of the true nature of the "Mazer wood," for
  he does not class it with his "gums, rootes, woods;" but, as before
  observed, in a heterogeneous collection which he styles "other variety of
  rarities." Presuming, as I do, that this Mazer wood was what we now term
  gutta percha, the question may be propounded, how could Tradescant have
  procured it from its remote <i>locale</i>? The answer is easy. In another
  part of the <i>Musæum Tradescantianum</i> may be found a list of the
  "benefactors" to the collection; and amongst their names occurs that of
  William Curteen, Esq. Now this William Curteen and his father Sir
  William, of Flemish Descent, were the most extensive British merchants of
  the time, and had not only ships trading to, but also possessed forts and
  factories on, some of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, the native
  <i>habitat</i> of the sapotaceous tree that yields the gutta percha.
  Curteen was a collector of curiosities himself, and no doubt his captains
  and agents were instructed to procure such: in short, a specimen of gutta
  percha was just as likely to attract the attention of an intelligent
  Englishman at Amboyna in the fifteenth century, as it did at Singapore in
  the nineteenth.</p>

  <p>If there are still any remains of Tradescant's collection in the
  Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, the question, whether the Mazer wood was
  gutta percha or not, might be soon set at rest; but it is highly probable
  that the men who ordered the relics of the Dodo to be thrown out, showed
  but little ceremony to the Mazer wood or dishes.</p>

  <p>A curious instance of a word, not very dissimilar to Mazer, may be
  found in Eric Red's Saga, part of the <i>Flatö Annals</i>, supposed to be
  written in the tenth century, and one of the authorities for the
  pre-Columbian discovery of America by the Icelanders. Karlsefne, one of
  the heroes of the Saga, while his ship was detained by a contrary wind in
  a Norwegian port, was accosted by a German, who wished to purchase his,
  Karlsefne's, broom.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'I will not sell it,' said Karlsefne. 'I will give you half a mark in
  gold for it,' said the German man. Karlsefne thought this a good offer,
  and thereupon concluded the bargain. The German man went away with the
  broom. Karlsefne did not know what wood it was; but it was <i>Mæsur</i>,
  which had come from Wineland!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps some reader may give an instance of Mazer wood being mentioned
  by other writers; or inform me if the word Mazer, in itself, had any
  peculiar signification.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Paul Pitcher Night.</i>&mdash;Can any of the contributors to "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" throw light upon a curious custom,
  prevalent in some parts of Cornwall, of throwing broken pitchers, and
  other earthen vessels, against the doors of dwelling-houses, on the eve
  of the Conversion of St. Paul, thence locally called "Paul pitcher
  night?" On that evening parties of young people perambulate the parishes
  in which the custom is retained, exclaiming as they throw the
  sherds,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"Paul's eve,</p>
      <p>And here's a heave!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to the received notions, the first "heave" cannot be
  objected to; but, upon its being repeated, the inhabitants of the house
  whose <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  seize the offenders, and inflict summary justice upon them; but, as they
  usually effect their escape before the door can be opened, this is not
  easily managed.</p>

  <p>Query, Can this apparently unintelligible custom have any reference to
  the 21st verse of the <span class="scac">IX</span>th chap. of St. Paul's
  Epistle to the Romans: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the
  same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto
  dishonour?"&mdash;the earthen fragments thus turned to dishonour being
  called "Paul's pitchers."</p>

  <p><i>Pursuits of Literature.</i>&mdash;How came the author of the
  <i>Pursuits of Literature</i> to be known? I have before me the 11th
  edition (1801); and in the Preface to the fourth and last dialogue, the
  author declares that "<i>neither my name nor situation in life will ever
  be revealed</i>." He does not pretend to be the sole depository of his
  own secret; but he says again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My secret will be for ever preserved, I <i>know</i>, under every
  change of fortune or of political tenets, while honour, and virtue, and
  religion, and friendly affection, and erudition, and the principles of a
  gentleman have binding force and authority upon minds so cultivated and
  dignified. When they fall, I am contented to fall with them."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the author of the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i> is
  known. How is this?</p>

  <p class="author">S. T. D.

  <p><i>Satirical Medal.</i>&mdash;I possess a medal whose history I should
  be glad to know. It is apparently of silver, though not ringing as such,
  and about an inch and a quarter in diameter. On the obverse are two
  figures in the long-waisted, full-skirted coats, cavalier hats, and
  full-bottomed wigs of, I presume, Louis XIV.'s time. Both wear swords;
  one, exhibiting the most developed wig of the two, offers a snuff-box,
  from which the other has accepted a pinch, and fillips it into his
  companion's eyes. The legend is "Faites-vous cela pour m'affronter?"</p>

  <p>The mitigated heroism of this <i>query</i> seems to be <i>noted</i> on
  the reverse, which presents a man digging in the ground, an operation in
  which he must be somewhat hampered by a lantern in his left hand;
  superfluous one would deem (but for the authority of Diogenes), as the
  sun is shining above his head in full splendour. The digger's opinion,
  that the two combined are not more than the case requires, is conveyed in
  the legend,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Je cherche du courage pour mon maistre."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The finding was curious. On cutting down an ash-tree in the
  neighbourhood of Linton, Cambridgeshire, in 1818, a knob on its trunk was
  lopped off, and this medal discovered in its core! It was probably the
  cause of the excrescence, having been, perhaps, thrust under the bark to
  escape the danger of its apparently political allusion. The Linton
  carrier purchased it for half-a-crown, and from him it passed in 1820
  into hands whence it devolved to me.</p>

  <p>Is anything known of this medal, or are any other specimens of it
  extant? I pretend to no numismatic skill, but to an unlearned mind it
  would seem to contain allusion to the insult which Charles II. and his
  government were supposed to submit to from Louis XIV.; to be, in fact, a
  sort of metallic HB.</p>

  <p>Some friend, I forget who, pronounced the workmanship Dutch, which
  would, I think, favour the above theory. The figures are in bold and
  prominent relief, but to a certain degree rounded by wear, having been
  evidently carried in the pocket for a considerable time.</p>

  <p><i>Inscription on an Oak Board.</i>&mdash;I have an old oak board, on

      <p class="hg3">"<span class="scac">IF . YOV . WOVLD . KNOW . MY . NAME .</span></p>

  <p>The letters are two inches long, and a quarter of an inch high from
  the sunken face of the board, which is four feet long by ten inches wide.
  It has a raised rim or border round the inscription; which proves that it
  had not contained more lines than as above. It was found at Hereford, in
  a county which still abounds in timbered houses, and it had been lately
  used as a weather-board. The legend was submitted to the late Sir Samuel
  Meyrick of Goderich Court; who was of opinion, that it had formerly been
  over the chimney-piece or porch of some dwelling-house, and is a riddle
  involving the builder's or founder's name. If any of your readers can

  of June a red letter-day in the first almanac ever printed. Who was St.
  Vitus, and how did he give his name to the play of the features which is

  Brecon, to go to Monmouthshire and seize Sir Trevor Williams of
  Llangevie, and Mr. Morgan, High Sheriff of Monmouth, "as," he writes,
  "they were very deep in the plot of betraying Chepstow Castle." Carlyle
  has the following foot-note to the letter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  that a new sheriff is soon appointed, we have no farther notice

  <p><i>The Wilkes MSS. and "North Briton."</i>&mdash;I inquired long since

  his judgement as to the propriety of publishing them, or a selection; but
  certainly to be preserved for the vindication of her father's memory;
  otherwise she would have destroyed them, or directed them to be
  destroyed. In 1811 these MSS. were, I presume, in the possession of Peter
  Elmsley, Principal of St. Alban's Hall, as he submitted the Junius
  Correspondence, through Mr. Hallam, to Serjeant Rough, who returned the
  letters to Mr. Hallam. Where now are the original Junius Letters, and
  where the other MSS.? The <i>Athenæum</i> has announced that the Stowe
  MSS., including the Diaries and Correspondence of George Grenville, are
  about to be published, and will throw a "new light" on the character of
  John Wilkes. I suspect any light obtained from George Grenville will be
  very like the old light, and only help to blacken what is already too
  dark. I therefore venture to ask once again, Where are the Wilkes MSS.?
  and can they be consulted? Further, are any of your readers able and

  <p><i>Canon and Prebendary.</i>&mdash;What is the difference between a

  Il est vrai que du commencement on nommait clercs canoniques, tous ceux

<h3>MESMERISM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 220.)</p>

  <p>I am much obliged to your correspondent A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;R. for his kind notice
  of my pamphlet on Mesmerism, and equally so to yourself for inserting it;
  because it gives me an opportunity of explaining to him, and others to
  whom I am personally unknown, and who are therefore not aware of my
  circumstances and movements, why the work was not continued without
  delay. In doing this I will try to avoid trespassing on your goodness by
  one word of needless egotism. In my Preface I described my materials as a
  "number of fragments belonging to various ages and places," as "scattered
  facts and hints" which I had met with in books which were not suspected
  of containing such matter; and some of them books not likely to fall into
  the hands of anybody but a librarian, or at least a person having access
  to a public library. It may be easily understood that rough materials
  thus gathered were not fit for <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>publication; and that, without the books
  from which they had been "noted" and "queried," they could not be made
  so: and if I had anticipated the course of events (notwithstanding an
  inducement which I will mention presently), I should not have thought of
  publishing a Part I. But when I sent it to the press, I had no idea that
  I should ever return here, or be at an inconvenient distance from the
  libraries which were then within my reach, and open to my use. As it was,
  I regretted that I had done so, and felt obliged to hurry the pamphlet
  through the press, that I might pack up these papers, and many other
  things more likely to be hurt by carriage, for a residence an hundred
  miles off; and here they are <i>in statu quo</i>. I have not attempted to
  do any thing with them, not only because I have been very much occupied
  in other ways, but because I do not know that I could fit them for
  publication without referring to some books to which I have not access.
  At the same time I feel bound to add, that while I still think that some
  of the things to which I refer might be worth printing, yet I do not
  consider them so important as the matter which formed the subject of the
  Part already published. I did think (and that was the inducement to which
  I have already referred) that it was high time to call the attention of
  disinterested and reflecting persons to the <i>facts</i> alleged by
  mesmerists, and to the <i>names</i> by which they are attested. I have
  the satisfaction of knowing that I have in some degree succeeded in this
  design. I may perhaps some day find a channel for publishing the
  fragments alluded to; but in the mean time, I shall be very glad if I can
  supply anything which your correspondent may think wanting, or explain
  anything unintelligible in what is published, if he will let me hear from
  him either with or without his name. I am sorry to ask for so much space,
  knowing how little you have to spare; but I cannot resist the temptation
  to offer an explanation, which will be so widely circulated, and among
  such readers as I know this will be, if you can find room for it.</p>

<h3>LORD HOWARD OF EFFINGHAM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 185.)</p>

  <p>The following observations, though slight in themselves, may tend to
  show that Charles Lord Howard of Effingham, afterwards Earl of
  Nottingham, was, or professed to be, a Protestant.</p>

  <p>1st. On his embassy to Spain, Carte says (I quote from Collins's
  <i>Peerage</i>, vol. iv. p. 272.)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On Friday the last of this Month His Catholick Majesty ratified the
  peace upon Oath in a great chamber of the palace.... It was pretended
  that the Clergy would not suffer this to be done in a Church or Chapel
  where the neglect of reverence of the Holy Sacrament would give
  scandal."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I presume the "neglect of reverence" was apprehended in the case of
  the English ambassador.</p>

  <p>2nd. In Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> (Surrey), speaking of Lord
  Nottingham, it is said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He lived to be very aged, who wrote 'man,' (if not married) in the
  first of Queen Elizabeth, being an invited guest at the solemn
  consecration of Matthew Parker at Lambeth; and many years after, by his
  testimony, confuted those lewd and loud lies which the papists tell of
  the Nag's Head in Cheapside."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3rd. He was one of the commissioners on the trial of Garnet and
  others; and told him, as he stood in a box made like a pulpit&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir, you have this day done more good in that pulpit wherein you now
  stand, than you have done in any other pulpit all the days of your
  life."&mdash;<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xv.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His coffin-plate has been engraved somewhere, and, if his will exists,
  it might probably settle the question.</p>

  <p class="author">Q. D.

  <p><i>Lord Howard of Effingham</i> (Vol. iii., p. 185.).&mdash;There is
  some proof that he was a Protestant in the letter of instructions to him
  from King James (<i>Biog. Brit.</i>, p. 2679.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Only we forewarn you, that in the performance of that ceremony, which
  is likely to be done in the King's (of Spain) chapel, you have especial
  care that it be not done in the forenoon, in the time of mass, to the
  scandal of <i>our</i> religion; but rather in the afternoon, at what time
  their service is more free from note of superstition."</p>

  his mission to Spain?</p>

<h3>IOVANNI VOLPE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 188.)</p>

  <p>The Volpes were an ancient, noble Florentine family of the second
  class, some branches of which according to the usage of Florence, changed
  their name, and adopted that of Bigliotti. The object of the change was
  to remove the disqualification which attached to them, as nobles, of
  holding offices under the republic. In illustration of this singular
  practice, the following extracts may be cited:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Le peuple nomma une commission pour corriger les statuts de la
  république, et réprimer par les lois l'insolence des nobles. Une
  ordonnance fameuse, connue sous le nom <i>d'Ordinamenti della
  Giustizia</i>, fut l'ouvrage de cette commission. Pour le maintien de la
  liberté et de la justice, elle sanctionna la jurisprudence la plus
  tyrannique, et la plus injuste. Trente-sept familles, les plus nobles et
  les plus respectables de Florence, furent exclus à jamais du priorat,
  sans qu'il leur fùt permis de recouvrer les droits de cité, en se <!--
  Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>faisant matriculer dans quelque corps de
  métier, ou en exerçant quelque profession.... Les membres de ces
  trente-sept familles furent désignés, même dans les lois, par les noms de
  grands et de magnats; et pour la première fois, on vit un titre d'honneur
  devenir nonseulement un fardeau onéreux, mais une
  punition."&mdash;Sismondi, <i>Histoire des Républiques Italiennes</i>,
  tom. iv. pp. 63-4.: Paris, 1826.</p>

  <p>"The people, now sure of their triumph, relaxed the Ordinances of
  Justice, and, to make some distinction in favour of merit or innocence,
  effaced certain families from the list of the nobility. Five hundred and
  thirty persons were thus elevated, as we may call it, to the rank of
  commoners. As it was beyond the competence of the Republic of Florence to
  change a man's ancestors, this nominal alteration left all the real
  advantage of birth as they were, and was undoubtedly an enhancenent of
  dignity, though, in appearance, a very singular one. Conversely, several
  unpopular commoners were ennobled in order to disfranchise them. Nothing
  was more usual, in subsequent times, than such an arbitrary change of
  rank, as a penalty or a benefit. (Messer Antonio de Baldinaccio degli
  Adimari, tutto che fosse de più grandi e nobili, per grazia era misso tra
  'l popolo.&mdash;<i>Villani</i>, xii. c. 108.) Those nobles who were
  rendered plebeian by favour, were obliged to change their name and
  arms."&mdash;Hallam's <i>Middle Ages</i>, vol. i. p. 435-6.: London,
  1834.</p>

  <p>"In the history of Florentine families, a singular feature presents
  itself; by a practice peculiar to Italy, nay, it is believed to Florence,
  families, under certain circumstances, were compelled to change their
  arms and their surnames, the origin of which was as follows. After having
  long suffered the insolent factions of the great families to convulse the
  state, the middle classes, headed indeed by one of the nobles, by a
  determined movement, obtained the mastery. To organize their
  newly-acquired power, they instituted an office, the chief at Florence
  during the republican era, that of Gonfalonier of Justice; they formed a
  species of national guard from the whole body of the citizens, who were
  again subdivided into companies, under the command of other officers of
  inferior dignity, also styled Gonfaloniers (Bannarets). As soon as any
  noble committed violence within the walls of the city, likely to
  compromise the public peace, or disturb the quiet of the state, the great
  bell at the Palazzo Vecchio raised its alarum, the population flew to
  arms, and hastened to the spot, where the Gonfalonier of Justice speedily
  found himself in a position, not merely to put an end to the disturbance,
  but even to lay siege to the stout massive fortresses which formed the
  city residences of the insolent and refractory offenders to which they
  then withdrew. But the reforming party did not stop there; by the new
  constitution, which was then introduced, the ancient noble families,
  termed by cotemporary historians 'i grandi,' and explained to include
  those only which had ever been illustrated by the order of knighthood,
  were all placed under a severe system of civil restrictions, and their
  names were entered upon a roll called the Ordinances of Justice; the
  immediate effect was that, losing all political rights, they were placed
  in a most disadvantageous position before the law.</p>

  <p>"By a remarkable species of democratic liberality, a man or a family
  might be emancipated from this position and rendered fit for office, born
  again as it were into a new political life, by renouncing their
  connections (consorteria) and changing their arms and surnames. They were
  then said to be made plebeian or popular (fatti di popolo). Niebuhr has
  noticed the analogy of such voluntary resignation of nobility to the
  'transitio ad plebem' of the Romans.</p>

  <p>"This practice of changing arms and surnames originated from the
  Ordinances of Justice promulgated about that time, which expressly
  requires this as a condition to the enjoyment by any of the old families
  of popular rights. It gave rise to great varieties of surnames and
  armorial bearings in different branches of the same house. But it has
  nevertheless been noted that in all these mutations it was still the
  endeavour of the parties to retain as much as possible of the ancient
  ensigns and appellations, so that traces of descent and connexion might
  not in the progress of years be altogether obliterated. Thus the
  Cavalcanti took the name of Cavallereschi, the Tornaquinci that of
  Tornabuoni. Sometimes they obtained the object by a play upon the name
  itself thus; at other times by making a patronymic of the Christian name
  of the first or some other favourite ancestor; thus a branch of the Bardi
  assumed the name of Gualterotti, and a branch of the Pazzi that of
  Accorri. Sometimes they took their new name from a place or circumstance
  calculated to preserve the memory of their origin; thus the Agolanti
  designated themselves Fiesolani, the Bostichi from the antiquity of their
  stock, Buonantichi. In mutation of arms a similar object was borne in
  mind. Thus the Buondelmonti simply added to their ancient bearings a
  mountain az. and a cross gu. The Baccelli, who were a branch of the
  Mazzinghi, replaced the three perpendicular clubs, the ancient ensigns of
  the family, by two placed in the form of a cross.</p>

  <p>"As the object of these provisions was to discriminate for the future
  those of the ancient families who had acceded to the principles of the
  popular institutions from their more haughty kindred, who remained true
  to the defence of their feudal and aristocratical pretensions, the change
  either of arms or surname was not required if the whole family became
  converts to the new doctrines; for then there was no need of
  discrimination, and the law was not framed out of any dislike merely to
  particular ensigns, but only to the principles and opinions which they
  had up to a certain time been understood to
  represent."&mdash;<i>Mazzinghi.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The identity of the Volpes and Bigliottis is attested by ancient
  sepulchral monuments of the family in Santo Spirito at Florence. To mark
  the ancient origin, they retained or assumed the fox (<i>volpe</i>) as
  their arms. Borghini, in his <i>Discorsi</i> (Florence, 1584-5), mentions
  the family as an instance of the name giving rise to the arms, and
  mentions Sandro Biglotti, 1339, as the first who assumed the fox as his
  ensigns. The distinction and influence enjoyed at Florence by the family
  is indicated by its having contributed ten Gonfaloniers of Justice to the
  republic; an office corresponding in rank with those of Doge of Venice
  <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span>and Doge of Genoa. Details of several
  branches of the family will be found in <i>Saggi Istorici D'Antichità
  Toscane di Lorenzo Cantini</i>: Firenze, 1798.</p>

  <p>Among the junta of twenty noblemen of Venice, chosen in 1355, on the
  discovery of the conspiracy of Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice, we find
  the name of "Ser Niccolò Volpe":&mdash;</p>

  <p>The only particulars of Iovanni Volpe furnished by the Gwerclas MSS.
  are given in the annexed pedigree. The marriage of his daughter Frances
  with my ancestor, Richard Hughes of Gwerclas, arose from the latter
  (before his accession to the family estates and representation,
  consequent on the decease without issue&mdash;February 6, 18 James I.,
  1620-1&mdash;of his elder brother, Humffrey Hughes, Esq., of Gwerclas,
  Baron of Cymmer-yn-Edeirnion, High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1618)
  having been secretary of the princely Cliffords, Earls of Cumberland, to
  whom Iovanni Volpe had been physician. There can be little doubt that
  Iovanni was descended from a branch of the Italian Volpes which had
  retained the ancient name; a supposition confirmed by the tradition of my
  family, and by the fact of the fox being assigned to his daughter Frances
  as her arms, in an emblazoned genealogy of the house of Gwerclas compiled
  in 1650 by the most accurate and eminent of Welsh antiquaries, Robert
  Vaughan of Hengwrt, Esq.</p>

  Hughes and Frances; the latter exhibiting in features an complexion the

  <p><i>Giovanni Volpe or Master Wolfe</i> (Vol. iii., p. 188.).&mdash;This
  person was certainly never "physician to Queen Elizabeth," but he may
  have received from her Majesty the appointment of apothecary, as he did
  from her successor. On New-Year's day, 1605-6, John Vulp presented to the
  king "a box of Indian plums," receiving in return 7 oz. di. di. qr. of
  gilt plate; he is then named the last of five apothecaries who paid their
  votive offerings to royalty. (Nichols's <i>Progresses, &amp;c. of King
  James I.</i>, vol. i. p. 597.) In 1617 he had risen to be the king's
  principal apothecary, and by the name of John Wolfgango Rumlero received
  "for his fee by the year 40 <i>li.</i>," as appears by the abstract of
  his Majesty's revenue attached to the pamphlet entitled <i>Time brought
  to Light by Time</i>. From the name here given him, it may be conjectured
  that he was rather from Germany than Italy. However, he also went by the
  plain English name of Master Wolfe.</p>

  <p>He is thus alluded to in the epilogue to Ben Jonson's <i>Masque of the
  Metamorphosed Gipsies</i>, when it was performed at Windsor in September,
  1621:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Sir Andrew Chadwick</i> (Vol. iii., p. 141.).&mdash;It was stated
  in evidence, in a trial at Lancaster assizes, Hilary Term, 1769, between
  Law and Taylor, plaintiffs, and Duckworth and Wilkinson, defendants,
  respecting the heirs at law of Sir Andrew Chadwick, and their claim to
  his estates, that "Ellis Chadwick married in Ireland a lady of fashion,
  who had some connexion with her late Majesty Queen Anne, and had issue by
  her the late Sir Andrew Chadwick. Ellis, the father, dying in his son's
  infancy, about the year 1693, his widow brought her son Andrew over to
  England, where he was very early introduced at court, and being
  contemporary with the young Duke of Gloucester, became a great favourite
  with him, was knighted, and had divers preferments."&mdash;From the
  Attorney-General's MS. Brief. The latter part of this statement does not
  appear to confirm the supposition recorded by <span class="sc">Mr. J.N.

  <p><i>Manuscript of Bede</i> (Vol. iii., p. 180.).&mdash;The volume in
  question is entered in the Catalogue of Thoresby's MSS., No. 10. in the
  <i>Ducatus Leodiensis</i>, p. 72. 2d ed. 1816. The greater part of these
  MSS. came into the hands of Ralph Thoresby, Jun., and, together with the
  coins, were disposed of by public auction in March, 1764, by Whiston
  Bristow, sworn broker. The MSS. were sold on the third day, but the
  volume containing Bede does not appear among them. The opinion formed by
  J.&nbsp;M. of the age of this MS. is certainly erroneous, and being on
  <i>paper</i> it is more probably of the <i>fifteenth</i> than the
  <i>twelfth</i> century. The period of William Dadyngton, Vicar of Barton,
  might decide this.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="grk">&mu;</span>.

  <p><i>MS. of Bede</i> (Vol. iii., p. 180.).&mdash;Your correspondent will
  find a description of this MS. in the catalogue of Thoresby's Museum, at
  the end of his <i>Ducatus Leodiensis</i>, edit. 1715, fol., p. 515. He
  will also, in Thoresby's <i>Correspondence</i>, 1832, 8vo. vol. ii. p.
  39., see a letter from Dr. John Smith, the editor of Bede's
  <i>History</i>, respecting this manuscript, the original of which letter
  is in my possession.</p>

  <p>After many dismemberments, what remained of Thoresby's Museum,
  including his manuscripts, was sold in London in March, 1764, by auction.
  Mr. Lilly, the bookseller of Pall Mall, had a priced catalogue of this
  sale; and your correspondent, if anxious to trace the pedigree of his MS.
  further, can, I have no doubt, on application, get a reference made to
  that catalogue.</p>

  <p>I take the present opportunity of mentioning that, as Mr. Upcott's
  sale, when I became the purchaser of the Thoresby papers, including his
  MS. diaries, his Album, and upwards of 1000 letters to him, a very small
  number of which were printed in the collection, in two volumes, edited by
  Mr. Hunter, one of the diaries, from May 14, 1712, to September 26, 1714,
  which was sold with the lot, was after the sale found to be missing. It
  subsequently came into the hands of a London dealer, by whom it was sold
  to a Yorkshire gentleman, as I understand, but whose name I have not yet
  been able to trace. Should this meet his eye, I will venture to appeal to
  his sense of justice, entirely ignorant as I am sure he has been of the
  "pedigree," to use your correspondent's expression, of his MS., whether
  he will allow it to be longer separated from the series to which it
  belongs, and which is incomplete without it. I need hardly say, I can
  only expect to receive it on the terms of repaying the price paid for it,
  and which I should embrace with many thanks.</p>

  <p><i>Closing of Rooms on account of Death</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  142.).&mdash;I am acquainted with a remarkable instance of this custom. A
  respectable farmer who resided in a parish in Bedfordshire, adjoining
  that in which I am writing, died in 1844; leaving to his daughter the
  fine old manor-house in which he had lived for many years, and in which
  he died, together with about 300 acres of land. The lady, with her
  husband, was then residing in a neighbouring village, where the latter
  rented a farm, which he has since given up, retaining the house; but she
  positively refused to remove to the manor-house, "because her father had
  died in it;" and as she still persists in her refusal, it is unoccupied
  to this day. For Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is not even permitted to let it,
  except a part, now tenanted by a valued friend of mine, which for many
  years has been let separately. The rooms and the furniture in them remain
  exactly as in the lifetime of the late occupant. The lady's husband, who
  farms the land attached to the house, is put to great inconvenience by
  living at a distance from it, but nothing will induce her to alter her
  determination. The facts I have related are notorious in the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p><i>Enigmatical Epitaph on Rev. John Mawer</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  184.).&mdash;On reading to a lady the article on this subject in a late
  Number, she immediately recollected, that about thirty years ago she had
  a governess of that name, the daughter of a clergyman in Nottinghamshire,
  who often mentioned that they were descended from the <i>Royal Family of
  Wales</i>, and that she had a brother who was named <i>Arthur Lewellyn
  Tudor Kaye Mawer</i>.</p>

  <p>This anecdote will perhaps be of use in directing attention to
  Cambrian pedigrees, and leading it from Dr. Whitaker's "Old King Cole" to
  "the noble race of Shenkin."</p>

  <p><i>Haybands in Seals</i> (Vol. iii., p. 186.).&mdash;The practice
  mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span>, of inserting haybands, or
  rather slips of rush, in the seals of feoffments, was common in all
  counties; and it certainly was not confined to the humbler classes.
  Hundreds of feoffments of the fifteenth century, and earlier, have passed
  through my hands with the seals as described by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span>, relating to various counties, and executed by parties of
  all degrees. In these instances, a little blade of rush is generally
  neatly inserted round the inner rim of the impression, and evidently must
  have been so done while the wax was soft. In some instances, these blades
  of rush overlay the whole seal; in others, a slip of it is merely tied
  round the label. In delivering seisin under a feoffment, the grantor, or
  his attorney, handed over to the grantee, together with the deed, a piece
  of turf, or a twig, or something plucked from the soil, in token of his
  giving full and complete possession. I have generally supposed that these
  strips of rush were the tokens of possession so handed over, as part and
  parcel of the soil, by the grantor; and that they were attached to the
  seal, as it were, "in perpetuam rei memoriam." In default of better
  information, I venture to suggest this explanation, but will not presume
  to vouch for its correctness.</p>

  <p><i>Notes on Newspapers</i> (vol. iii., p. 164.).&mdash;John Houghton,
  the editor of the periodical noticed by your correspondent, <i>A
  Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade</i>, was one of
  those meritorious men who well deserve commemoration, though his name is
  not to be found in any biography that I am acquainted with. He was an
  apothecary, and became a dealer in tea, coffee, and chocolate. He was in
  politics a loyalist, or Tory, and was admitted a member of the Royal
  Society in 1679-80. He began to publish his <i>Letters on Husbandry and
  Trade</i> in 1681. No. 1. is dated Thursday, September 8, 1681. The first
  collection ended June, 1684, and consists of two vols. 4to. In November,
  1691, Houghton determined to resume his old plan of publishing papers on
  Husbandry and Trade. His abilities and industry were warmly recommended
  by several members of the Royal Society: Sir Peter Pott, John Evelyn, Dr.
  Hugh Chamberlain, and others. The recommendation is prefixed to the first
  number of this second collection. The first paper is dated Wednesday,
  March 30, 1692; and the second Wednesday, April 6, 1692; they were
  continued every succeeding Wednesday. The concluding paper was published
  September 24, 1703. There were 583 numbers, in 19 vols., of the folio
  papers. The last number contains an "Epitome" of the 19 vols. and a
  "Farewell," which gives his reason for discontinuing the paper, and
  thanks to his assistants, "wishing that knowledge may cover the earth as
  the water covers the sea." A selection from these papers was published in
  1727, by Richard Bradley, F.R.S., in three vols. 8vo., to which a fourth
  was afterwards added in 1728, 8vo.</p>

  <p>Houghton also published <i>An Account of the Acres and Houses, with
  the proportional Tax, &amp;c. of each County in England and Wales</i>.
  Lond. 1693, on a broadside. Also, <i>Book of Funds</i>, 1694, 4to.

  <p><i>Duncan Campbell</i> (Vol. i., p. 186.).&mdash;There seems to be no
  doubt that Duncan Campbell, whose life was written by Defoe, was a real
  person. See <i>Tatler</i>, vol. i. p. 156. edit. 1786, 8vo.;
  <i>Spectator</i>, No. 560.; Wilson's <i>Life of Defoe</i>, vol. iii. p.
  476. His house was "in Buckingham Court, over against Old Man's Coffee
  House, at Charing <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>{249}</span>Cross," and at another period of his life
  in Monmouth Court. He is reported to have amassed a large fortune from
  practising upon the credulity of the public, and was the grand answerer
  of "Queries" in his day. Defoe's entertaining pieces relating to him are
  evidently novels founded upon fact.</p>

  <p><i>Christmas Day</i> (Vol. iii., p. 167.).&mdash;Julian I. has the
  credit of transferring the celebration of Christ's birth from Jan. 6th to
  Dec. 25th; but Mosheim considers the report very questionable (vol. i. p.
  370. Soames's edit.). Bingham, in his <i>Christian Antiq.</i>, devotes
  ch. iv. of book xx. to the consideration of this festival, and that of
  the Epiphany; but does not notice the claim set up on behalf of Julian
  I.; neither Neander (vol. iii. pp. 415-22. Eng. Translation). It would
  appear that the Eastern Church kept Christmas on Jan. 6th, and the
  Western Church on Dec. 25th: at length, about the time of Chrysostom, the
  Oriental Christians sided with the Western Church. Bingham also cites
  Augustine as saying that it was the current tradition that Christ was
  born on the eighth of the kalends of January, that is, on the 25th of
  December. Had, therefore, Julian I. dogmatically fixed the 25th of
  December as the birthday of our Saviour, it is scarcely possible to
  suppose that Augustine, who flourished about half a century later, would
  allege current tradition as the reason, without any notice of Julian.</p>

  <p><i>Christmas-day</i> (Vol. iii, p. 167.).&mdash;St. John of
  Chrysostom, archbishop of Nice (died <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 407),
  in an epistle upon this subject, relates (tom. v. p. 45. edit. Montf.
  Paris, 1718-34) that, at the instance of St. Cyril of Jerusalem (died
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 385), St. Julius (Pope <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 337-352) procured a strict inquiry to be made
  into the day of our Saviour's nativity, which being found to be the 25th
  Dec., that day was thenceforth set apart for the celebration of this
  "Festorum omnium metropolis," as he styles it. St. Tilesphorus (Pope
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 128-139), however, is supposed by the
  generality of ancient authorities to be the first who appointed the 25th
  Dec. for that purpose. The point is involved in much uncertainty, but
  your correspondent may find all the information he seeks in <i>Baronii
  Apparatus ad Annales Ecclesiasticos</i>, fol., Lucæ, 1740, pp. 475. et
  seq.; and in a curious tract, entitled <i>The Feast of Feasts; or, the
  Celebration of the Sacred Nativity of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus
  Christ; grounded upon the Scriptures, and confirmed by the Practice of
  the Christian Church in all Ages</i>. 4to. Oxf. 1644. This tract is in
  the British Museum. J.&nbsp;C. makes a tremendous leap in chronology when he
  asks "Was it not either Julius I. or II.?" Why the one died exactly 1161
  years after the other!</p>

  (to whom he gave the name of Darnley) by Miss Ledley, created Countess of

  and secondly to Sheffield Duke of Buckingham, by whom she was mother of

  were the families of Morse and Ireton connected? it appears that Jane,
  only child of Richard Lloyd (of Norfolk?), Esq., by Jane, second daughter
  of Ireton, married, circa 1700, Nicholas or Henry Morse. But what appears
  to me most likely to have occasioned the report of Lord Bexley's
  connexion with the Cromwell family is, that the late Oliver Cromwell,
  Esq., of Cheshunt, married Miss Mary Morse in 1771, which must have been
  not far from the period when Lord Bexley's mother, also a Miss Morse, was
  married to Mr. Vansittart.</p>

  <p><i>The Countess of Desmond</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 153. 186. 219.
  317.).&mdash;Touching this venerable lady, the following "Note" may not
  be unacceptable.</p>

  <p>In the year 1829, when making a tour in Ireland, I saw an engraving at
  Lansdowne Lodge, in the county of Kerry, the residence of Mr. Hickson, on
  which the following record was inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Catherine Fitzgerald, Countess of Desmond (from the original in the
  possession of the Knight of Kerry on Panell).</p>

  <p>"She was born in 1464; married in the reign of Edw. IV.; lived during
  the reigns of Edw. V., Rich. III., Hen. VII., Hen. VIII., Edw. VI., Mary,
  and Elizabeth; and died in the latter end of James' or the beginning of
  Charles I.'s reign, at the great age of 162 years."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On my return home I was much surprised and gratified to find in my own
  house, framed and glazed, a very clever small-sized portrait in crayon,
  which at once struck me a a fac-simile (or nearly so) of the engraving I
  had seen at Lansdowne Lodge.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent C. in p. 219. appears very sceptical about this
  female Methuselah! and speaks of a reputed portrait at Windsor "as a
  gross imposition, being really that of an old man"&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>but I would remind your correspondent C. that such longevity is not
  impossible, and the traditions of the Countess of Desmond are widely
  diffused. The portrait in my possession is not unlike an old man; but old
  ladies, like old hen pheasants, are apt to put on the semblance of the
  male.</p>

  <p><i>Aristophanes on the Modern Stage</i> (Vol. iii., p. 105.).&mdash;In
  reply to a Query of our correspondent C.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;R., I beg leave to state,
  that, after having made inquiry on the subject, I cannot find that any of
  the Comedies of Aristophanes have ever been introduced upon the English
  stage, although I agree with him in thinking that some of them might be
  advantageously adapted to the modern theatre; and I am more confirmed in
  this opinion from having witnessed at the Odéon in Paris, some years
  since, a dramatic piece, entitled "Les Nuées d'Aristophane," which had a
  great run there. It was not a literal translation from the Greek author,
  but a kind of mélange, drawn from the Clouds and Plutus together. The
  characters of Socrates and his equestrian son were very well performed;
  but the scenic accessories I considered very meagre, particularly the
  choral part, which must have been so striking and beautiful in the
  original of the former drama. Upon my return to England I wrote to the
  then lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, recommending a similar experiment on
  our stage from the free version by Wheelwright, published some time
  before by the late D.&nbsp;A. Talboys, of Oxford. The answer I received was,
  that the manager had then too much on his hands to admit of his giving
  time to such an undertaking, which I still think might be a successful
  one (as is the case with the "Antigone" <!-- Page 251 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>of Sophocles, so often
  represented at Berlin), and such as to ensure the favourable attention of
  an English audience, particularly as the subject turns so much upon the
  danger and uselessness of the meteoric or visionary education, then so
  prevalent at Athens.</p>

  <p><i>On a Passage in the Tempest</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 259. 299. 337. 429.
  499.).&mdash;If you will allow me to offer a conjecture on a subject,
  which you may think has already been sufficiently discussed in your
  pages, I shall be glad to submit the following to the consideration of
  your readers.</p>

  <p>The passage in the <i>Tempest</i>, Act III. Scene 1., as quoted from
  the first folio, stands thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12hg3">"I forget:</p>
      <p>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours</p>
      <p>Most busie lest, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This was altered in the second folio to</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busie least, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Instead of which Theobald proposes,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busyless, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But "busyless" is not English. All our words ending in <i>less</i>
  (forming adjectives), are derived from Anglo-Saxon nouns; as love, joy,
  hope, &amp;c., and never from adjectives.</p>

  <p>My conjecture is that Shakespeare wrote&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12hg3">"I forget:</p>
      <p>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labour's</p>
      <p>Most business, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Most" being used in the sense of "greatest," as in <i>Henry VI.</i>,
  Pt. I., Act IV. Scene 1., (noticed by Steevens):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But always resolute in most extremes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Thus the change of a single syllable is sufficient to make good
  English, good sense, and good metre of a passage which is otherwise
  defective in these three particulars. It retains the <i>s</i> in
  "labours," keeps the comma in its place, and provides that antecedent for
  "it," which was justly considered necessary by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span>.</p>

  the top of which he ascended for the purpose of viewing the country.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> we have another explanation also
  (<i>sub voce</i>), as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arthur's Seat is said to be derived, or rather corrupted, from A'rd
  Seir, a 'place or field of arrows,' where people shot at a mark: and this
  not improperly; for, among these cliffs is a dell, or recluse valley,
  where the wind can scarcely reach, now called the Hunter's Bog, the
  bottom of it being a morass."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The adjacent crags are supposed to have taken their name from the
  Earl of Salisbury; who, in the reign of Edward III., accompanied that
  prince in an expedition against the Scots."</p>

</blockquote>

  genitive), or "airthes height," not unnaturally corrupted to "Arthur's
  Seat."</p>

  the Henry de Craigmillar, who built the castle (now in ruins) in the
  twelfth century. There is a charter in the reign of Alexander II., in
  1212, by William, son of Henry de Craigmillar, to the monastery of
  Dunfermline, which is the earliest record of the castle.</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of "Harrisers"</i> (Vol. ii., p. 376.).&mdash;I am told
  that the practice which <span class="sc">Clericus Rusticus</span> <!--
  Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>speaks of, holds in Yorkshire, but not the
  name.</p>

  <p>In Devon a corn-field, which has been cut and cleared, is called an
  "arrish." A vacant stubblefield is so called during the whole of the
  autumn months.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent suggests "arista;" can he support this
  historically? If not, it is surely far-fetched. Let me draw attention to
  a word in our English Bible, which has been misunderstood before now by
  readers who were quite at home in the original languages: "<i>earing nor
  harvest</i>" (Genesis). Without some acquaintance with the earlier forms
  of our mother tongue, one is liable to take <i>earing</i> to mean the
  same as "harvest," from the association of <i>ears</i> of corn. But it is
  the substantive from the Anglo-Saxon verb <i>erian</i>, to plough, to
  till: so that "earing nor harvest" = "sowing nor reaping." From
  <i>erian</i> we may pass on to <i>arare</i>, and from that to
  <i>arista</i>: in the long pedigree of language they are scarcely
  unconnected: but the Anglo-Saxon is not <i>derived</i> from the Latin;
  they are, each in its own language, genuine and independent forms. But it
  is curious to see what an attraction these distant cousins have for one
  another, let them only come within each other's sphere of
  gravitation.</p>

  <p>In, Yorkshire the verb <i>to earland</i> is still a <i>living</i>
  expression; and a Yorkshireman, who has more Saxon than Latin in him,
  will not write "arable land," but "<i>ear</i>able land." A Yorkshire
  clergyman tells me that this orthography has been perpetuated in a local
  act of parliament of no very ancient date.</p>

  <p>Putting all these facts together, I am inclined to think that "arrish"
  must first mean "land for tillage;" and that the connexion of the word
  with "gleaning" or "gleaners" is the effect of association, and therefore
  of later date.</p>

  <p>But it must be observed, there is a difference between "arrish" and
  "harrisers." Can it be shown that Dorset-men are given to aspirating
  their words? Besides this, there is a great difference between
  "arri<i>ss</i>ers" and "arri<i>sh</i>ers" for counties so near as Dorset
  and Devon. And again, while I am quite familiar with the word "arrish," I
  never heard "arrishers," and I believe it is unknown in Devonshire.</p>

  <p class="author">J. E.

  <p>Oxford.</p>

  <p><i>Harrisers or Arrishers.</i>&mdash;Doubtless, by this time, some
  dozen Devonshire correspondents will have informed you, for the benefit
  of <span class="sc">Clericus Rusticus</span>, that <i>arrishers</i> is
  the term prevailing in that county for "stubble." The Dorset harrisers
  are therefore, perhaps, the second set of gleaners, who are admitted to
  the fields to pick up from the stubble, or <i>arrishes</i>, the little
  left behind by the reapers' families. A third set of gleaners has been
  admitted from time immemorial, namely, the <i>Anser stipularis</i>, which
  feeds itself into plump condition for Michaelmas by picking up, from
  between the stubble, the corns which fell from the ears during reaping
  and sheaving. The Devonshire designation for this excellent sort of
  poultry&mdash;known elsewhere as "stubble geese"&mdash;is "arrish
  geese."</p>

  <p><i>Chaucer's "Fifty Wekes"</i> (Vol. iii., p. 202.).&mdash;A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.'s
  natural and ingeniously-argued conjecture, that Chaucer, by the "<i>fifty
  wekes</i>" of the <i>Knightes Tale</i>, "meant to imply the interval of
  <i>a solar year</i>,"&mdash;whether we shall rest in accepting the poet's
  measure of time loosely and poetically, or (which I would gladly feel
  myself authorised to do) find in it, with your correspondent, an
  astronomical and historical reason,&mdash;is fully secured by the
  comparison with Chaucer's original.</p>

  <p><i>The Almond Tree, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. iii., p. 203.).&mdash;The
  allusions in Hall's poem, stanzas iii. &amp; v., refer to the fine
  allegorical description of human decrepitude in <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, xii.

  <p>The pertinence of these solemn figures has been sufficiently explained
  by biblical commentators. It is to be presumed that the reference to a
  source so well known as the Bible would have occurred at once to the
  Querist, had not the allusions, in the preceding stanza, to the
  <i>heathen</i> fable of Medea, diverted his thoughts from that more
  familiar channel.</p>

  <p><i>St. Thomas's Onions</i> (Vol. iii., p. 187.).&mdash;In reference to
  the Query, Why is St. Thomas frequently mentioned in connexion with
  onions? I fancy the reason to be this. There is a variety of the onion
  tribe commonly called <i>potato</i> or <i>multiplying onion</i>. It is
  the rule to <i>plant</i> this onion on St. Thomas's day. From this
  circumstance it appears to me likely that this sort of onion may be so
  called, though I never heard of it before. They are fit for use as large
  hard onions some time before the other sort.</p>

  <p><i>Roman Catholic Peers</i> (Vol. iii., p. 209.).&mdash;The proper
  comment has been passed on the Duke of Norfolk, but not on the other two
  Roman Catholic peers mentioned by Miss Martineau. She names Lord Clifford
  and Lord Dormer as "having obtained entrance <i>at last</i> to the
  legislative assembly, where their fathers sat and ruled when their faith
  was the law of the land." The term "fathers" is of course figuratively
  used, but we may conclude the writer meant to imply their ancestors
  possessing the same dignity of peerage, and enjoying, in virtue thereof,
  the right of "sitting and ruling" in the senate of their country. If such
  was the lady's meaning, what is her historical accuracy? The first Lord
  Dormer was created in the reign of James I., in the year 1615; and, dying
  the next year, never sat in parliament: and it has been remarked as a
  very singular fact that this barony had existed for upwards of two
  centuries before any of its possessors did so. But the first Lord Dormer,
  who sat in the House of Lords, was admitted, not by the Roman Catholic
  Relief Act, but by the fact of his being willing to take the usual oaths:
  this was John, the tenth lord, who succeeded his half-brother in 1819,
  and died without issue in 1826. As for Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, that
  family was not raised to the peerage until the year 1672, in the reign of
  Charles II.</p>

  commence with the publication of the historical matter: while the laws of
  Howel Dda, having been recently published by the Record Commission, will
  not be included; by which means it is expected the original Welsh text
  and English translations of the rest of the work can be comprised in four
  or five volumes, as the greatest care will be paid to the quantity of
  matter and its accuracy, as well as typographical excellence, so as to
  ensure the largest amount of information at the least expense. We need
  hardly say that this patriotic undertaking has our heartiest wishes for
  its success.</p>

  <p>The Rev. J. Forshall, one of the editors of the recently published
  <i>Wickliffe Bible</i>, has just edited, under the title of
  <i>Remonstrance against Romish Corruptions in the Church, addressed to
  the People and Parliament of England in 1395, 18 Ric. II.</i>, a most
  valuable paper drawn up by Purvey, one of Wickliffe's friends and
  disciples, for the king, lords, and commons, then about to assemble in
  parliament. As presenting a striking picture of the condition of the
  English Church at the time, when combined efforts were first made with
  any zealousness of purpose for its amendment and reform; and affording a
  tolerably complete sketch of the views and notions of the Wickliffite
  party on those points of ecclesiastical polity and doctrine, in which
  they were most strongly opposed to the then prevailing opinions; this
  publication is an extremely valuable contribution to the history of a
  period in our annals, which has scarcely yet received it due share of
  attention: while the great question which is agitating the public mind
  renders the appearance of Purvey's tract at this moment peculiarly
  well-timed. Mr. Forshall has executed his task in a very able manner; the
  introduction is brief and to the purpose, and the short glossary which he
  has appended is just what it should be.</p>

  <p>The Camden Society has lately added a very important work to its list
  of intended publications. It is the <i>St. Paul's Domesday of the Manors
  belonging to the Cathedral in the year 1222</i>, and is to be edited with
  an introduction and illustrative notes, by Archdeacon Hale.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell, on Monday
  next and four following days, a selection of valuable Books, including
  old poetry, plays, chap-books, and drolleries, and some important MSS.
